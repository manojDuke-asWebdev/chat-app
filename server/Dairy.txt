   "Aim" to build is complete the chat room.
   Technlogies inclueded ejs, express, socket.io, node.js
   Cons message does not appears on sender side.
   Pros clean, no style here I can focus on operations.
   
   "description": It is very simple prototype, it is working,
   upon three concepts from socket "connection", "event" and
   "emit".

   "Summary": The server and client both are connected by 
   events. server and client both has same method to share
   the message that named emit(). this all are lay upon 
   "connnection".

   "Aim" I want to add extra feature like show the username of
   sender,and name. it was possible by sever-side object 
   maintance. 
   
   "working": In previos server catch message from client and 
   broadcast, except sender it deliver message to all client
   now the emit is append to according event. Through the emit
   can the server can respond sender.
   'username', 'name' is submited by client by prompt box each
   message consist username data so, the server directly 
   broadcast the user infomation with message. The client-side
   -engine will disply the message with username.

   "Summary":
